SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle
Software Development
Software: It is in our daily life and we use it for shopping, banking, communication, navigation
All software is built with code.
IDEA: Hey guys, I have an idea that is going to help people to do _______.
Requirement document - tech guy - Tools and designs
Development: Writing code that evolves into the software product.
Software = UI + API + DB
Database first -> foundation - skeleton
Backend Developer + System Architect + CTO + Engineering Director
Database: Tables, foreign keys, primary keys, columns
	
What is the Database you guys are using in your current company?
Oracle, MSSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Cassandra, PortreSQL
What is the framework that your backend developers use?
Java - springboot
C# - .NET
JavaScript - NodeJS, ExpressJS
Ruby - Ruby on Rails
Pyhton - Django
SELECT - CREATE - DELETE - SET
GET - POST - DELETE - PUT
Add user / delete user / update user / view user / delete all users
API - Services - Micro-Services - End points
Building services that creates, updates, deletes data
API-Test
Postman -> Manual
Rest-Assured -> automation
BUG: It is our(developers) mistake. HUMAN ERROR
UI: HTML - CSS - JavaScript
Framework: ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS
WE ARE RESPOBSIBLE FOR ALL LAYERS - UI - API - DB
MANUAL - Web Page | Postman | SQL Developer / MSSQL
Automation - Selenium | Rest-Assured | JDBC / Nuget package
End to end testing
1. User flow - UX
2. UI-API-DB layers
if(singUpButton.clicked()){
if(f)
	return "{firstName= "Akin" ".....
}
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE phone=3120000000 AND password=123456789;
1 row
