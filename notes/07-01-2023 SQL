	RECAP:

	Data:
		Raw and unprocessed information.
		Then we process the data to make it meaningful

	Database:
		It is based on hardwares and softwares. It is a collection of information that is organized in a way makes it easy to access, manage, and manipulate.

		Unrelational database
			- It is not organized
			- Faster
			- Stores the information in a single JSON file
			- It can be stored in key/value pairs

		Relational datbase
			- It is organized
			- Table-based structured to store data
			- Used Structured Query language (SQL) to update, manipulate and retrieve the data.
			- Each table must have a relation with 1 or more table to create the conenction between the tables.
			- Column limit is 1204 and the limit of the rows depends on the data or storage capacity of the cloud.


		SQL(Structured Query Language)
			Used Structured Query language (SQL) to update, manipulate and retrieve the data. It is standart language that is used by many database managemenet system.

			Oracle, MsSQL, Postgre, etc

		SELECT <columnName> FROM <tableName>

		- It is case insensitive
		- But it is recommended to use upper case for the keywords


		SELECT				-> Selects the column
		FROM 				-> Selects the table
		WHERE				-> Filtering condition

		AND 				-> This is continious action of condition before that 							can be followed by WHERE, BETWEEN etc.
		OR

		BETWEEN				-> It gives us the range between 2 int values, INCLUDING
		CONCAT()			-> It concats two string or data together
								we can also use || (pipes)
		LIKE				-> If we are checking if the data starts with, ends with 						or contains any specific character, we MUST use LIKE
		AS 					-> It's called Aliases, helps us to assign a value to 							column name, or re-name the column, or assign a 							value to table
		ORDER BY			-> So it orders the column by Ascending or Descending 							order. ORDER BY first_nem ASC.

		NOTE: If you want to order by Ascending, you dont have to explicitly write the ASC keyword it will does it implicitly. But if you want to order by Descending, you have to use DESC keyword.

		IS / IS NOT       	-> It is used for NULL values

		SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
		WHERE comission_pct is NULL;

		IN 					-> We can use instead of OR, and we can call all the 							conditions in ( ).
